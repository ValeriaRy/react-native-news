## Setup

Since the app is based on react native, you need to set up your environment for that stack. As of this writing that means installing node, watchman and the react native CLI.

```
brew install node
brew install watchman
sudo gem install cocoapods
npm install -g react-native-cli
npm install
```

You also need the latest version of Xcode installed on your machine as well.

Now run the app on iOS

    react-native run-ios

or on Android. You need install Android Studio and run virtual device.

    react-native run-android
